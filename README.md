# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's a classic game where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player gets three in a row or all the spaces are filled.

The game can be played by clicking on the grid cells. The player who gets three in a row wins the game. The game also includes a reset button that resets the game back to its initial state.

The game uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Google Fonts for the font.
